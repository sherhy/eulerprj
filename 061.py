'''
P3,n = n(n+1)/2
P4,n = n**2
P5,n = n(3n-1)/2
P6,n = n(2n-1)
P7,n = n(5n-3)/2
P8,n = n(3n-2)

the ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281 has three interesting properties.
1. the set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first)
2. each polygonal type: P3,127 = 8128, P4,91 = 8281, P5,44 = 2882 is represented by a different number in the set.
3. this is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this proeperty

find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: P3-8,n is represented by a different number in the set.
